      to add image

      <!-- Css general syntax
     1) Selector{
        property:value;
      } 
      To select via class name-
      .classname{

      } 
      To select via ids- An id is unique but a class maynot be.
      #idname{

      }
   2) Note we can also have multiple class initialised to same element,eg-
    <img class="class1 class2">
    use-
    .class1{

    }
    .class2{

    }
   3) pseudo class in css-
    eg: :hover
    img:hover
    {
        //the property written in these will be active when hovered
    }
    
    
-->

<!-- 4)We cannot change width of inline element that's why we inline-block element -->

<!-- 5) TO align the element at center use-
   Firstly,text-align : center in body(or parent element).This will work as long as we have full width element(block with full width). 
   eg, if we change width say 10% of the element then it will remove from center alignment as it does not have full block width.
   Note- text align center will align everything that does not have a width, if they have width use margin:auto.

   Secondly,
    for horizontal alignment use-
   element{
    margin:0 auto 0 auto;
   }
   for vertical alignment use-
   element{
    margin:auto 0 auto 0 ;
   }

6)Somtimes the font we use is not installed on user computer, so insted of using using multiple options of default font family we use
  embedded font by copying font link in the head of webpage from (fonts.google.com).

  7)To increse font size dont use px use rem(em & % are not used bcz the child %(em) gets multiplied by parent %(em) but rem is relative to root).
   1em=16px=100%

  8)line height: 2  , increases line space between two lines in text by two times.

  9)float:left/right , to wrap the text around the image/element.Inorder to prevent some portion of text from
   wrap around image use "clear:left/right".

 10) To remove underline from anchor tags use-0 text-decoration:none;
 11) To create button go to cssbutton generator wbsite -->
